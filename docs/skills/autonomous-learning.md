# Autonomous skill learning

!!! Info

    This feature is currently in development and will be available soon.

`freeact` agents already improve their code actions automatically based on code execution feedback. They also support [collaborative skill development](collaborative-learning.md).
We are currently enhancing them further to autonomously store, index, load and improve skills on demand based on task details and current state.
