> Freeact code action agent

Freeact is a lightweight, general-purpose agent that acts via code actions rather than JSON tool calls.
It writes executable Python code that can call multiple tools programmatically, process intermediate
results, and use loops and conditionals in a single pass. Tasks that would otherwise require many
inference rounds with JSON tool calling can be completed in one code action.

The agent auto-generates typed Python modules from MCP tool schemas, enabling programmatic tool calling
within code actions. Beyond task execution, freeact can save successful code actions as discoverable
tools and enhance existing tools with output parsers, acting as a toolsmith in its workspace. Agent
skills provide filesystem-based capability packages that extend behavior for specific domains.

All code executes locally in a sandboxed IPython kernel via ipybox. An optional sandbox mode restricts
filesystem and network access for executed code. Tool and skill information loads progressively as
needed rather than consuming context upfront. A unified approval mechanism gates all code actions,
programmatic tool calls, and JSON tool calls.
