## Overview

Freeact is a library for building agents that act by generating and executing code. Actions generated by freeact agents:

- have a broad action space since they can install and use any Python library dynamically
- can be autonomously improved by reflecting on execution feedback
- can be incrementally learned and improved with a human in the loop
- can be stored as skills in long-term memory for faster reuse
- can compose previously learned skills to form higher-level capabilities

Freeact agents can be deployed as general-purpose agents out-of-the-box or specialized to particular environments using custom skills, domain knowledge, and runbooks:

- custom skills provide optimized interfaces for interacting with specific environments
- domain knowledge guides the agent to refine and adapt its skills within specialized domains
- runbooks define agent behavior, rules, and constraints in natural language, and can be improved over time
- runbooks also enable flexible, human-in-the-loop workflows for interactive planning, confirmations, and other user feedback

Freeact is a single-agent system with multi-step reasoning, reflective improvement loops, and secure code execution provided by ipybox. It can also be integrated into multi-agent environments by leveraging existing multi-agent frameworks or encapsulating other agents as reusable skills.
